## Bitcoin

### Bitcoin consists of
 - A decentralized peer-to-peer network (**the bitcoin protocol**)
 - A public transaction ledger (**the blockchain**)
 - A set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance (**consensus rules**)
 - A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain (**Proof-of-Work algorithm**)

### History of Bitcoin
 - "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto
 - "Byzantine Generals" problem: Satoshi Nakamoto's solution, which uses the concept of Proof-of-Work to achieve consensus without a central trusted authority.
